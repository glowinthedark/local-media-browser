# Local Media Browser
A local media browser app for navigating a file systems that contains images, audio or video files with associated content such as PDF, HTML, or TXT. 

The app is implemented as a local web server that opens a page in your browser with content split into a file navigation side panel, a media panel for video or audio, and a content panel for PDF and HTML.

For displaying PDF files the browser must have the corresponding plugins â€” Chrome and Firefox support PDFs out of the box. For displaying PDF files in Internet Explorer, Adobe Reader must be installed.

#### Features:

* M3U playlist generation for folders that contain media files
* browsing images with thumbnail previews in the left panel (gallery mode)
* displaying PDF and HTML content with associated audio/video links
* user-defined regular expressions for matching media files to PDF, HTML or text content (`config.js`)
* adjustable playback speed for media files
* resizable navigation and content panels
* auto-open browser window on server start
* custom media root folder can be specified as first argument (by default the system root will be used (e.g. `/` or `c:\` on windows).
* start/stop media playback on click or on spacebar press.

Example: if a folder contains a PDF file named `lesson-01.pdf` and a video file named `lesson-01.mp4`, then clicking the PDF file will display it in the bottom content panel while the video playback will start in the top media panel.
