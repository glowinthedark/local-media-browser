# Local Media Browser
A minimalistic local media browser for navigation a local file system that contains audio or video files with associated content files such as PDF, HTML, TXT.

For example, if a folder contains a video file named `lesson-01.mp4` and a PDF file named `lesson-01.pdf` then clicking either of the files will load both files in the corresponding panels on the page so that you can listen or watch the video while reading the PDF notes at the same time.
