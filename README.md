# Local Media Browser
A minimalistic local media browser app for navigating a local file system that contains audio or video files with associated content such as PDF, HTML, or TXT. It is implemented as a local web server that opens a page in your browser with content split into a file navigation side panel, a media panel for video or audio, and a content panel for PDF and HTML.

For displaying PDF files the browser must have the corresponding plugins â€” Chrome and Firefox support PDFs out of the box, while for Internet Explorer you must have Adobe Reader installed.

Features:

* browsing PDF and HTML content with associated audio/video links.
* adjustable playback speed for media files
* resizable navigation and content panels
* user-defined regular expressions for matching media files to PDF, HTML or text content (config.js)
* auto-open browser window on server start
* custom media root folder can be specified as first argument (`/` or `c:` by default).
* start/stop media playback on click or on spacebar press.

For example, if a folder contains a PDF file named `lesson-01.pdf` and a video file named `lesson-01.mp4`, then clicking the PDF file will display it in the content panel while the video playback will start in the media panel above it.
